Collective is a Jekyll based theme built during my internship at [BowTie.io](http://www.bowtie.io). It was created from their base styles and components. I utilized the JavaScript library [Isotope.js](http://isotope.metafizzy.co/) to achieve gallery layout and filter capability. I wireframed the entire site before building it, and used SASS for styling. The site was made to be compatible with BowTie.io's collection editor so users can start their own website with this theme without having to touch a line of code.

You are currently viewing a live version of this theme, and you can browse the [GitHub repository here](https://github.com/Fallenstedt/Collective-Theme).
