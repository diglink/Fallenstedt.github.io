Fallenstedt Photo is a website I built for my photography while attending Epicodus. I wanted to be able to display all of my best work by categories so potential clients can explore my work easily. I built this website with the purpose of testing my knowledge on the Silex framework, responsive web design, and PHP. I used the JavaScript plugin Slick Carousel for each of my photography galleries for easier deployment. I utilized the PHP framework [Silex]() and the [Twig]() template engine to build this website.

You can view the live website at [FallenstedtPhoto](http://fallenstedtphoto.com), or you can browse its [GitHub repository here](https://github.com/Fallenstedt/fallenstedt-photo).
