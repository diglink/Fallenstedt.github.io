Herbonomics was built by a team of 6 individuals for our final PHP project. Our team consisted of 4 PHP students and 2 CSS students. The goal of the project was to develop an ancillary business for the cannabis industry that would help connect businesses together. It allows cultivators and retailers of Oregon's legal industry to create accounts and search through a supply of cannabis flowers for purchase. Users can inspect each strain's test results, batch result and research information on the cultivator's growing practices. Future versions would allow other stakeholders in this industry to offer their services including security, lighting, and growing equipment.

I worked with my group on designing the backend of this project. We divided our work so half the team built CRUD functionality for cultivators, and the other half working on CRUD functionality for retailers. The challenging part of this project was working with group members who are proficient in languages other than PHP. We worked well together by communicating and teaching eachother so the site would have consistency in styling, search results, and navigation across pages.
