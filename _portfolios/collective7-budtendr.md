Budtendr was a web app built for my final JavaScript group project. Our team's goal was to build a tool that allowed users to search for cannabis strains, find the best deals near them, and explore recreational dispensaries in their area. We built this website with Angular2 so we could test our knowledge on a JavaScript MVC. One of the greatest challenges I had when working on this group project was building the search result page. We were working with a custom API that our group member built so we could retrieve our information from a MySQL database. I also worked on designing the logo, our search function, and making the web app mobile friendly.
