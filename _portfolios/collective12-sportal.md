Sportal is a social network built for my final Drupal 7 group project. Our group wanted to build a website for individuals to manage their pick-up games, leagues, or events like runs or races. It also allows users to add and review locations where sport events can be held. We built this website to test our knowledge on Drupal 7 theming, extending and developing modules, and practicing AJAX. Our group focused a lot on implementing google maps so users could find sport events more easily and promote their own events by purchasing ad space through our e-commerce module . My focus on this project was extending a Drupal 7 theme with custom regions, styling, and implementing AJAX for our search function.

The greatest challenge I had when developing this site was exploring someone else's code and extending it. I spent a lot of time browsing our theme's code and modifying it with regions so we could display content where users could find it easily. I also worked on filling parts of each webpage with valuable content so users can explore the site and find content relevant to them. We had a total of 4 days to work on this project, and we have plans to continue working on the sites user interface and user experience.
