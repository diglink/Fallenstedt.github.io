Agency is a Jekyll based theme built during my internship at [BowTie.io](http://www.bowtie.io). It was made off their base styles and components. I wireframed the entire site before building, and built two new components for BowTie.io. The first was a portfolio component that allows users to have either a scrolling gallery or a carousel gallery. By checking a box on BowTie.io's collection editor, a user can modify the styles of the HTML document without having to touch a line of code.

The second component that I made in this theme was the timeline component. Users can add as many sections to the timeline using BowTie.io's collection editor and the timeline will respond by alternating information on either side of the photo.

You can view the [live demo](http://www.portfolio-dev.bowtied.io/), or you can browse the [GitHub repository here](https://github.com/Fallenstedt/Artist-Theme).
