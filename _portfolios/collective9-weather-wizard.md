Weather Wizard was a one day project meant to explore JavaScript promises and Weather APIs. This project used Open Weather Map API to obtain temperature and humidity of a city entered by a user. Depending on the temperature at that city, the body of the webpage changes color. Warmer environments change the body to a salmon pink, while colder environments will transition to a light orange and then a baby blue.
