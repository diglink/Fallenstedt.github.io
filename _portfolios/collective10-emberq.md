This ember2 project was built to test my knowledge on computed properties, services, and custom helpers. The web app allows users to post a question anonymously, and allows other users to reply to that specific question. I had one day to work on this project while studying ember2 in our JavaScript class.

One of the greatest challenges was learning how to structure an ember2 project. It was a great learning experience to explore an MVC and how it can make models reusable without modification.
