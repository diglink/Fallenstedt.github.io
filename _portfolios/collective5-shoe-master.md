Shoe Master was my final independent code project for my PHP class. It allows users to manage their shoe brands and the stores at which they are present. It utilized object oriented PHP, behavior driven development, database creation with MySQL, and join statements.

The biggest challenge I had when developing this site was writing join statements. I had to understand the one-to-many relationship I had with my shoe stores and the brands in order to select the correct information from my database.
