While employed by [Sticky Co](http://sticky.tv/), I had the opportunity to assist in building an interactive part of [History Hub](http://www.ohs.org/museum/exhibits/history-hub.cfm), an Oregon Historical Society permanent exhibit.

My focus on this project was the data collection part of the application. The interactive exhibit needed to record a user's answers about where they currently live, where they were born, and origins of their ancestors. I was approached to provide a solution that would easiest for the user to use. I utilized Google Maps API to provide a user with map that would reverse geocode a marker's coordinates. This information was displayed to a user for confirmation and later saved on their approval into a MySQL database.

Users could then explore this information with an interactive slide show that would generate statistics from the dataset. For performance and flexibility, the team I worked with utilized D3.js to generate different map projections and customize them to the look and feel of our designer's mockups. We generated simple data sets that would depict trends in our data set, like most common state a person was born in, to more complex ones that would calculate distance between two points on a sphere to see who travelled the farthest to Oregon Historical Society that week.
